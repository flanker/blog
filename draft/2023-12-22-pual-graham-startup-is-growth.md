# Startup = Growth

Pual Graham, September 2012

A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of "exit." The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.

创业公司是一个旨在快速发展的公司。仅仅是一家新成立的公司并不意味着它就是一家创业公司。创业公司也不一定非要从事技术工作，或者获得风险投资，或者有某种形式的“退出”机制。唯一必要的条件是增长。创业公司的其他一切都源于增长。

If you want to start one it's important to understand that. Startups are so hard that you can't be pointed off to the side and hope to succeed. You have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost every decision you face.

如果你想开启一个创业公司，重要的是要明白这一点。创业是如此困难，以至于你不能被指向一边，希望成功。你必须知道，你追求的是增长。好消息是，如果你获得了增长，其他一切往往会顺利进行。这意味着你可以像指南针一样利用增长来做出几乎所有的决策。

Redwoods 红杉树

Let's start with a distinction that should be obvious but is often overlooked: not every newly founded company is a startup. Millions of companies are started every year in the US. Only a tiny fraction are startups. Most are service businesses — restaurants, barbershops, plumbers, and so on. These are not startups, except in a few unusual cases. A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast. Whereas a search engine, for example, is.

让我们从一个明显但常常被忽视的区别开始：并不是每个新成立的公司都是创业公司。每年在美国都有数百万家公司成立，但只有极少数是创业公司。大多数是服务业务，比如餐馆、理发店、水管工等等。除非是一些特殊情况，否则这些都不是创业公司。理发店并不是为了快速增长而设计的，而搜索引擎则是。

When I say startups are designed to grow fast, I mean it in two senses. Partly I mean designed in the sense of intended, because most startups fail. But I also mean startups are different by nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny from a bean sprout.

当我说创业公司被设计成快速增长时，我有两个意思。部分意思是指有意图地设计，因为大多数创业公司都会失败。但我也指的是创业公司天生与众不同，就像一颗红杉幼苗与一颗豆芽有着不同的命运。

That difference is why there's a distinct word, "startup," for companies designed to grow fast. If all companies were essentially similar, but some through luck or the efforts of their founders ended up growing very fast, we wouldn't need a separate word. We could just talk about super-successful companies and less successful ones. But in fact startups do have a different sort of DNA from other businesses. Google is not just a barbershop whose founders were unusually lucky and hard-working. Google was different from the beginning.

这种差异是为什么有一个独特的词语“创业公司”来形容那些旨在快速成长的公司。如果所有公司本质上都是相似的，只是有些公司通过运气或创始人的努力最终快速成长，我们就不需要一个单独的词语。我们可以只谈论超级成功的公司和不那么成功的公司。但事实上，创业公司与其他企业有着不同的基因。谷歌不仅仅是一家理发店，其创始人非常幸运和努力。谷歌从一开始就与众不同。

To grow rapidly, you need to make something you can sell to a big market. That's the difference between Google and a barbershop. A barbershop doesn't scale.

要快速发展，你需要制造一些可以销售给大市场的东西。这就是谷歌和理发店之间的区别。理发店无法扩展规模。

For a company to grow really big, it must (a) make something lots of people want, and (b) reach and serve all those people. Barbershops are doing fine in the (a) department. Almost everyone needs their hair cut. The problem for a barbershop, as for any retail establishment, is (b). A barbershop serves customers in person, and few will travel far for a haircut. And even if they did, the barbershop couldn't accomodate them. [1]

对于一家公司要真正做大，它必须（a）生产出许多人需要的产品，并且（b）接触并为所有这些人提供服务。理发店在（a）方面做得很好。几乎每个人都需要理发。对于理发店来说，问题在于（b），就像对于任何零售店一样。理发店是亲自为顾客提供服务的，而且很少有人会为了理发而远行。即使他们愿意，理发店也无法容纳他们。[1]

Writing software is a great way to solve (b), but you can still end up constrained in (a). If you write software to teach Tibetan to Hungarian speakers, you'll be able to reach most of the people who want it, but there won't be many of them. If you make software to teach English to Chinese speakers, however, you're in startup territory.

编写软件是解决(b)的好方法，但你仍然可能受到(a)的限制。如果你编写软件来教匈牙利人学习藏语，你将能够满足大部分需要的人，但他们的数量不会很多。然而，如果你开发软件来教中国人学习英语，你就进入了创业领域。

Most businesses are tightly constrained in (a) or (b). The distinctive feature of successful startups is that they're not.

大多数企业在(a)或(b)方面受到严格限制。成功创业公司的独特之处在于它们不受限制。

Ideas 想法

It might seem that it would always be better to start a startup than an ordinary business. If you're going to start a company, why not start the type with the most potential? The catch is that this is a (fairly) efficient market. If you write software to teach Tibetan to Hungarians, you won't have much competition. If you write software to teach English to Chinese speakers, you'll face ferocious competition, precisely because that's such a larger prize. [2]

创办一家初创公司似乎总是比创办一家普通企业更好。如果你要创办一家公司，为什么不选择潜力最大的类型呢？问题在于这是一个（相对）高效的市场。如果你开发软件教匈牙利人学习藏语，你将面临很少的竞争。如果你开发软件教中国人学习英语，你将面临激烈的竞争，因为这是一个更大的奖励。[2]

The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them. That's the tradeoff. If you start a barbershop, you only have to compete with other local barbers. If you start a search engine you have to compete with the whole world.

限制普通公司的同时也保护了它们。这就是权衡。如果你开一家理发店，你只需要与其他当地理发师竞争。如果你开一家搜索引擎，你就需要与全世界竞争。

The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business protect it from is not competition, however, but the difficulty of coming up with new ideas. If you open a bar in a particular neighborhood, as well as limiting your potential and protecting you from competitors, that geographic constraint also helps define your company. Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient idea for a small business. Similarly for companies constrained in (a). Your niche both protects and defines you.

约束对于一家正常企业最重要的保护对象并不是竞争，而是产生新想法的困难。如果你在一个特定的社区开一家酒吧，除了限制你的潜力和保护你免受竞争对手的侵害，地理约束还有助于定义你的公司。酒吧+社区对于一家小企业来说已经是一个足够的创意。同样适用于受到约束的公司（a）。你的利基既保护又定义着你。

Whereas if you want to start a startup, you're probably going to have to think of something fairly novel. A startup has to make something it can deliver to a large market, and ideas of that type are so valuable that all the obvious ones are already taken.

如果你想要创办一家初创公司，你可能需要考虑一些相当新颖的东西。初创公司必须生产出能够供应给大市场的产品，而这类想法非常有价值，以至于所有明显的想法都已经被占用了。

That space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup generally has to work on something everyone else has overlooked. I was going to write that one has to make a conscious effort to find ideas everyone else has overlooked. But that's not how most startups get started. Usually successful startups happen because the founders are sufficiently different from other people that ideas few others can see seem obvious to them. Perhaps later they step back and notice they've found an idea in everyone else's blind spot, and from that point make a deliberate effort to stay there. [3] But at the moment when successful startups get started, much of the innovation is unconscious.

那个思想空间已经被彻底搜寻过了，所以一家初创公司通常必须致力于其他人忽视的事物。我本来想写一篇文章，说人们必须有意识地努力寻找其他人忽视的想法。但是，大多数成功的初创公司并不是这样开始的。通常情况下，成功的初创公司之所以成功，是因为创始人与其他人有足够的不同，以至于其他人看不到的想法对他们来说显而易见。也许后来他们会退后一步，注意到他们在其他人的盲点中找到了一个想法，并从那时起努力保持在那个位置。[3]但是在成功的初创公司开始时，很多创新是无意识的。

What's different about successful founders is that they can see different problems. It's a particularly good combination both to be good at technology and to face problems that can be solved by it, because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas often become good without anyone noticing. Steve Wozniak's problem was that he wanted his own computer. That was an unusual problem to have in 1975. But technological change was about to make it a much more common one. Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one. And the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for millions of people in the coming years. But by the time it was obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was already established.

成功创始人的不同之处在于他们能够看到不同的问题。能够擅长技术并面对可以通过技术解决的问题是一种特别好的组合，因为技术变化如此迅速，以至于以前的不好的想法往往在没有人注意到的情况下变得很好。史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克的问题是他想要自己的电脑。这在1975年是一个不寻常的问题。但是技术变革即将使它变得更加普遍。因为他不仅想要一台电脑，而且知道如何制造它们，沃兹尼亚克能够为自己制造一台电脑。他为自己解决的问题在接下来的几年里成为苹果为数百万人解决的问题。但是当普通人意识到这是一个巨大的市场时，苹果已经建立起来了。

Google has similar origins. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to search the web. But unlike most people they had the technical expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as good as they could be, and to know how to improve them. Over the next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough. But as happened with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search was, Google was entrenched.

谷歌有着类似的起源。拉里·佩奇和谢尔盖·布林想要搜索互联网。但与大多数人不同的是，他们具备技术专长，能够意识到现有的搜索引擎并不如他们所期望的那样好，并且知道如何改进它们。在接下来的几年里，他们的问题变成了每个人的问题，因为互联网的规模不断增长，你不必成为一个挑剔的搜索专家就能注意到旧的算法不够好。但就像苹果一样，当其他人意识到搜索的重要性时，谷歌已经牢固地占据了市场。

That's one connection between startup ideas and technology. Rapid change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas. Sometimes the changes are advances, and what they change is solubility. That was the kind of change that yielded Apple; advances in chip technology finally let Steve Wozniak design a computer he could afford. But in Google's case the most important change was the growth of the web. What changed there was not solubility but bigness.

这是创业创意和技术之间的一个联系。某个领域的快速变化揭示了其他领域的重大可解决问题。有时候这些变化是进步，而它们改变的是可解决性。这就是产生苹果公司的那种变化；芯片技术的进步最终让史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克设计出了一台他能负担得起的计算机。但在谷歌的情况下，最重要的变化是互联网的增长。那里发生的变化不是可解决性，而是规模的扩大。

The other connection between startups and technology is that startups create new ways of doing things, and new ways of doing things are, in the broader sense of the word, new technology. When a startup both begins with an idea exposed by technological change and makes a product consisting of technology in the narrower sense (what used to be called "high technology"), it's easy to conflate the two. But the two connections are distinct and in principle one could start a startup that was neither driven by technological change, nor whose product consisted of technology except in the broader sense. [4]

创业公司与技术之间的另一个联系是，创业公司创造了新的做事方式，而新的做事方式在更广义上来说就是新技术。当一个创业公司既以技术变革带来的想法为起点，又以狭义上的技术（曾被称为“高科技”）为产品时，很容易混淆这两者。但这两种联系是不同的，原则上可以创办一家既不受技术变革驱动，也不以技术为产品（除了更广义上的技术）的创业公司。[4]

Rate 费率

How fast does a company have to grow to be considered a startup? There's no precise answer to that. "Startup" is a pole, not a threshold. Starting one is at first no more than a declaration of one's ambitions. You're committing not just to starting a company, but to starting a fast growing one, and you're thus committing to search for one of the rare ideas of that type. But at first you have no more than commitment. Starting a startup is like being an actor in that respect. "Actor" too is a pole rather than a threshold. At the beginning of his career, an actor is a waiter who goes to auditions. Getting work makes him a successful actor, but he doesn't only become an actor when he's successful.

一家公司要成为创业公司，需要以多快的速度增长？对此没有确切的答案。“创业公司”是一个极点，而不是一个门槛。最初创业只是宣示自己的雄心壮志。你不仅要承诺创办一家公司，还要承诺创办一家快速增长的公司，因此你要寻找那种罕见的创意之一。但最初你只有承诺而已。创办创业公司就像是演员一样。同样，“演员”也是一个极点而不是门槛。在他的职业生涯开始时，演员是一个去试镜的服务员。找到工作使他成为成功的演员，但他并不仅仅在成功时才成为演员。

So the real question is not what growth rate makes a company a startup, but what growth rate successful startups tend to have. For founders that's more than a theoretical question, because it's equivalent to asking if they're on the right path.

所以真正的问题不是什么增长率使一家公司成为初创企业，而是成功的初创企业往往具有什么增长率。对于创始人来说，这不仅仅是一个理论问题，因为这等同于问他们是否走在正确的道路上。

The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:

成功创业公司的发展通常有三个阶段：

There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing.

初创企业在试图弄清楚自己在做什么的过程中，会有一个缓慢或没有增长的初始阶段。

As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid growth.

随着初创公司找到了如何制造大量人们想要的产品，并且找到了如何接触到这些人的方法，就会出现快速增长的阶段。

Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves. [5]

最终，一家成功的初创公司将会成长为一家大公司。增长将会放缓，部分是由于内部限制，部分是因为公司开始受到所服务市场的限制。[5]

Together these three phases produce an S-curve. The phase whose growth defines the startup is the second one, the ascent. Its length and slope determine how big the company will be.

这三个阶段共同形成了一个S曲线。定义初创公司的是第二个阶段，即上升阶段。它的长度和斜率决定了公司的规模大小。

The slope is the company's growth rate. If there's one number every founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate. That's the measure of a startup. If you don't know that number, you don't even know if you're doing well or badly.

斜率是公司的增长率。如果有一个数字是每个创始人都应该知道的，那就是公司的增长率。这是一个创业公司的衡量标准。如果你不知道这个数字，你甚至不知道自己做得好还是不好。

When I first meet founders and ask what their growth rate is, sometimes they tell me "we get about a hundred new customers a month." That's not a rate. What matters is not the absolute number of new customers, but the ratio of new customers to existing ones. If you're really getting a constant number of new customers every month, you're in trouble, because that means your growth rate is decreasing.

当我第一次遇到创始人并询问他们的增长率时，有时他们告诉我"我们每个月大约获得一百个新客户"。那不是一个速率。重要的不是新客户的绝对数量，而是新客户与现有客户的比例。如果你每个月真的获得一个恒定数量的新客户，那就麻烦了，因为这意味着你的增长率正在下降。

During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what they're doing. [6]

在 Y Combinator 期间，我们每周测量增长率，部分原因是因为在 Demo Day 之前时间很短，部分原因是因为初创公司在早期需要频繁从用户那里获得反馈，以调整他们的工作。[6]

A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.

在 YC 期间，良好的增长率是每周 5-7%。如果你能达到每周 10%，那就非常出色。如果你只能达到 1%，那说明你还没有弄清楚自己在做什么。

The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users. That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably be a constant multiple of active users. [7]

衡量增长率最好的指标是收入。对于最初没有收费的初创公司来说，下一个最好的指标是活跃用户。这是一个合理的收入增长的替代指标，因为无论何时初创公司开始试图赚钱，他们的收入很可能是活跃用户数量的一个恒定倍数。[7]

Compass 指南针

We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate they think they can hit, and then just try to hit it every week. The key word here is "just." If they decide to grow at 7% a week and they hit that number, they're successful for that week. There's nothing more they need to do. But if they don't hit it, they've failed in the only thing that mattered, and should be correspondingly alarmed.

我们通常建议初创公司选择一个他们认为可以达到的增长率，然后每周努力去实现它。关键词在于“只是”。如果他们决定每周增长 7%，并且达到了这个数字，那么他们在那一周就是成功的。他们不需要做更多的事情。但是如果他们没有达到这个目标，他们就在唯一重要的事情上失败了，应该相应地感到警惕。

Programmers will recognize what we're doing here. We're turning starting a startup into an optimization problem. And anyone who has tried optimizing code knows how wonderfully effective that sort of narrow focus can be. Optimizing code means taking an existing program and changing it to use less of something, usually time or memory. You don't have to think about what the program should do, just make it faster. For most programmers this is very satisfying work. The narrow focus makes it a sort of puzzle, and you're generally surprised how fast you can solve it.

程序员会认识到我们在这里做的事情。我们将创业变成了一个优化问题。而任何尝试过优化代码的人都知道，这种狭窄的专注是多么有效。优化代码意味着对现有程序进行修改，以使用更少的资源，通常是时间或内存。你不需要考虑程序应该做什么，只需让它更快。对大多数程序员来说，这是非常令人满意的工作。这种狭窄的专注使它成为一种谜题，你通常会惊讶地发现自己能够多快地解决它。

Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewilderingly multifarious problem of starting a startup to a single problem. You can use that target growth rate to make all your decisions for you; anything that gets you the growth you need is ipso facto right. Should you spend two days at a conference? Should you hire another programmer? Should you focus more on marketing? Should you spend time courting some big customer? Should you add x feature? Whatever gets you your target growth rate. [8]

专注于实现增长率可以将创业公司的复杂问题简化为一个单一问题。你可以利用目标增长率来为你做出所有决策；任何能帮助你实现所需增长的事情都是正确的。你应该花两天时间参加会议吗？你应该雇佣另一个程序员吗？你应该更加注重市场营销吗？你应该花时间追求一些大客户吗？你应该添加x功能吗？任何能帮助你实现目标增长率的事情。[8]

Judging yourself by weekly growth doesn't mean you can look no more than a week ahead. Once you experience the pain of missing your target one week (it was the only thing that mattered, and you failed at it), you become interested in anything that could spare you such pain in the future. So you'll be willing for example to hire another programmer, who won't contribute to this week's growth but perhaps in a month will have implemented some new feature that will get you more users. But only if (a) the distraction of hiring someone won't make you miss your numbers in the short term, and (b) you're sufficiently worried about whether you can keep hitting your numbers without hiring someone new.

仅仅通过每周的增长来评判自己，并不意味着你只能看一周的前景。一旦你经历了错过目标的痛苦（那是唯一重要的事情，而你却失败了），你就会对任何可以避免未来这种痛苦的事情感兴趣。因此，你可能愿意雇佣另一个程序员，虽然他不会对本周的增长做出贡献，但也许一个月后他会实现一些新功能，从而为你带来更多用户。但前提是：（a）雇佣某人的分散注意力不会让你在短期内错过目标，（b）你对能否在不雇佣新人的情况下继续达到目标感到足够担心。

It's not that you don't think about the future, just that you think about it no more than necessary.

不是说你不考虑未来，只是你只考虑必要的程度。

In theory this sort of hill-climbing could get a startup into trouble. They could end up on a local maximum. But in practice that never happens. Having to hit a growth number every week forces founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit of succeeding. Nine times out of ten, sitting around strategizing is just a form of procrastination. Whereas founders' intuitions about which hill to climb are usually better than they realize. Plus the maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good ideas are adjacent to even better ones.

理论上，这种爬坡式的方法可能会让初创公司陷入麻烦。他们可能会陷入局部最大值。但实际上从来没有发生过这种情况。每周都必须达到增长目标迫使创始人采取行动，而采取行动与不采取行动是成功的关键。十次中有九次，坐在那里制定战略只是一种拖延的形式。而创始人对于要攀登哪座山的直觉通常比他们意识到的要好。此外，初创公司创意空间中的最大值并不是尖锐而孤立的。大多数相当不错的创意都与更好的创意相邻。

The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can actually discover startup ideas. You can use the need for growth as a form of evolutionary pressure. If you start out with some initial plan and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10% weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than you meant to start. But anything that grows consistently at 10% a week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with.

优化增长的迷人之处在于它实际上可以发现创业点子。你可以将增长需求作为一种进化压力。如果你从一开始就制定了一些初始计划，并根据需要进行修改，以保持每周10%的增长率，你最终可能会得到一个与最初打算完全不同的公司。但是，任何以每周 10%的一致增长速度增长的事物几乎肯定比你最初的想法更好。

There's a parallel here to small businesses. Just as the constraint of being located in a particular neighborhood helps define a bar, the constraint of growing at a certain rate can help define a startup.

这里有一个与小企业相似的对比。就像被限制在特定社区的位置定义了一家酒吧一样，以一定速度增长的限制可以定义一家创业公司。

You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads rather than being influenced by some initial vision, just as a scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather than being influenced by what he wishes were the case. When Richard Feynman said that the imagination of nature was greater than the imagination of man, he meant that if you just keep following the truth you'll discover cooler things than you could ever have made up. For startups, growth is a constraint much like truth. Every successful startup is at least partly a product of the imagination of growth. [9]

你最好遵循这个限制，无论它带你去哪里，而不是受某种最初的愿景的影响，就像科学家最好是按照真相的指引而不是受到他希望的情况的影响一样。当理查德·费曼说自然的想象力比人类的想象力更伟大时，他的意思是如果你只是继续追求真相，你会发现比你能想象的更酷的事情。对于初创企业来说，增长就像真相一样是一种限制。每个成功的初创企业至少在某种程度上都是增长想象力的产物。[9]

Value 价值

It's hard to find something that grows consistently at several percent a week, but if you do you may have found something surprisingly valuable. If we project forward we see why.

很难找到每周以几个百分点稳定增长的东西，但如果你找到了，可能会发现它意外地有很大价值。如果我们向前推算，就能明白为什么了。

|---|---|
| weekly 每周 | yearly 每年 |
| 1% | 1.7x |
| 2% | 2.8x |
| 5% | 12.6x |
| 7% | 33.7x |
| 10% | 142.0x |
|---|---|

A company that grows at 1% a week will grow 1.7x a year, whereas a company that grows at 5% a week will grow 12.6x. A company making $1000 a month (a typical number early in YC) and growing at 1% a week will 4 years later be making $7900 a month, which is less than a good programmer makes in salary in Silicon Valley. A startup that grows at 5% a week will in 4 years be making $25 million a month. [10]

一个每周增长 1% 的公司一年将增长 1.7倍，而一个每周增长 5% 的公司一年将增长 12.6倍。一个每月收入 1000美元（YC早期的典型数字）并每周增长 1% 的公司，4年后每月收入将达到 7900美元，这比硅谷一名优秀程序员的薪水还要低。一个每周增长 5% 的初创公司，4年后每月收入将达到 2500万美元。[10]

Our ancestors must rarely have encountered cases of exponential growth, because our intuitions are no guide here. What happens to fast growing startups tends to surprise even the founders.

我们的祖先很少遇到指数增长的情况，因此我们的直觉在这里没有任何指导作用。快速增长的初创企业发生的事情往往会让创始人感到惊讶。

Small variations in growth rate produce qualitatively different outcomes. That's why there's a separate word for startups, and why startups do things that ordinary companies don't, like raising money and getting acquired. And, strangely enough, it's also why they fail so frequently.

小幅增长率的变化会产生截然不同的结果。这就是为什么有一个专门的词来形容初创公司，以及为什么初创公司会做一些普通公司不会做的事情，比如筹集资金和被收购。而且，奇怪的是，这也是为什么它们经常失败的原因。

Considering how valuable a successful startup can become, anyone familiar with the concept of expected value would be surprised if the failure rate weren't high. If a successful startup could make a founder $100 million, then even if the chance of succeeding were only 1%, the expected value of starting one would be $1 million. And the probability of a group of sufficiently smart and determined founders succeeding on that scale might be significantly over 1%. For the right people — e.g. the young Bill Gates — the probability might be 20% or even 50%. So it's not surprising that so many want to take a shot at it. In an efficient market, the number of failed startups should be proportionate to the size of the successes. And since the latter is huge the former should be too. [11]

考虑到成功的创业公司可以变得非常有价值，任何熟悉预期价值概念的人都会对失败率不高感到惊讶。如果一个成功的创业公司可以让创始人赚取 1亿美元，即使成功的机会只有 1%，创业的预期价值也将达到 100万美元。而一群足够聪明和决心的创始人在这个规模上成功的概率可能会显著超过 1%。对于合适的人来说，比如年轻的比尔·盖茨，成功的概率可能达到 20%甚至 50%。所以，很多人想尝试一下也就不足为奇了。在一个有效的市场中，失败的创业公司数量应该与成功的规模成比例。而由于后者非常庞大，前者也应该如此。[11]

What this means is that at any given time, the great majority of startups will be working on something that's never going to go anywhere, and yet glorifying their doomed efforts with the grandiose title of "startup."

这意味着在任何特定时刻，绝大多数初创公司都在做一些注定不会有所成就的事情，然而却以“初创公司”的宏大称号来美化他们注定失败的努力。

This doesn't bother me. It's the same with other high-beta vocations, like being an actor or a novelist. I've long since gotten used to it. But it seems to bother a lot of people, particularly those who've started ordinary businesses. Many are annoyed that these so-called startups get all the attention, when hardly any of them will amount to anything.

这不会困扰我。和其他高风险职业一样，比如演员或小说家，情况都是一样的。我早就习惯了。但是似乎很多人都感到困扰，特别是那些从事普通生意的人。他们很生气，认为这些所谓的创业公司得到了所有的关注，而其中几乎没有一个会有所成就。

If they stepped back and looked at the whole picture they might be less indignant. The mistake they're making is that by basing their opinions on anecdotal evidence they're implicitly judging by the median rather than the average. If you judge by the median startup, the whole concept of a startup seems like a fraud. You have to invent a bubble to explain why founders want to start them or investors want to fund them. But it's a mistake to use the median in a domain with so much variation. If you look at the average outcome rather than the median, you can understand why investors like them, and why, if they aren't median people, it's a rational choice for founders to start them.

如果他们退一步，看整个情况，他们可能会少一些愤怒。他们犯的错误是，通过基于个别证据来形成自己的观点，他们在暗示性地以中位数而不是平均数来判断。如果你以中位数判断创业公司，整个创业概念似乎就像是一种欺诈。你必须发明一个泡沫来解释为什么创始人想要创办它们，或者为什么投资者想要资助它们。但在一个变化如此多样的领域使用中位数是一个错误。如果你看的是平均结果而不是中位数，你就能理解为什么投资者喜欢它们，以及为什么，如果他们不是中位数的人，创始人选择创办它们是一个理性的选择。

Deals

Why do investors like startups so much? Why are they so hot to invest in photo-sharing apps, rather than solid money-making businesses? Not only for the obvious reason.

为什么投资者如此喜欢初创企业？为什么他们如此热衷于投资于照片分享应用，而不是稳定盈利的企业？不仅仅是因为显而易见的原因。

The test of any investment is the ratio of return to risk. Startups pass that test because although they're appallingly risky, the returns when they do succeed are so high. But that's not the only reason investors like startups. An ordinary slower-growing business might have just as good a ratio of return to risk, if both were lower. So why are VCs interested only in high-growth companies? The reason is that they get paid by getting their capital back, ideally after the startup IPOs, or failing that when it's acquired.

任何投资的测试是回报与风险的比率。初创公司通过了这个测试，因为尽管它们的风险令人担忧，但一旦成功，回报非常高。但这并不是投资者喜欢初创公司的唯一原因。如果两者都较低，一个普通的增长较慢的企业可能有同样好的回报与风险比率。那么为什么风险投资公司只对高增长的公司感兴趣呢？原因是他们通过获得资本回报来获得报酬，理想情况下是在初创公司首次公开募股后，或者在初创公司被收购时。

The other way to get returns from an investment is in the form of dividends. Why isn't there a parallel VC industry that invests in ordinary companies in return for a percentage of their profits? Because it's too easy for people who control a private company to funnel its revenues to themselves (e.g. by buying overpriced components from a supplier they control) while making it look like the company is making little profit. Anyone who invested in private companies in return for dividends would have to pay close attention to their books.

从投资中获得回报的另一种方式是以股息的形式。为什么没有一个与之相对应的风险投资行业，以投资普通公司并获得其利润的一部分呢？因为控制私人公司的人很容易将其收入转移到自己手中（例如通过从他们控制的供应商购买高价组件），同时让公司看起来利润很少。任何以股息为回报投资私人公司的人都必须密切关注他们的账目。

The reason VCs like to invest in startups is not simply the returns, but also because such investments are so easy to oversee. The founders can't enrich themselves without also enriching the investors. [12]

风险投资家喜欢投资初创企业的原因不仅仅是因为回报，还因为这样的投资非常容易监督。创始人无法使自己富裕而不使投资者富裕。[12]

Why do founders want to take the VCs' money? Growth, again. The constraint between good ideas and growth operates in both directions. It's not merely that you need a scalable idea to grow. If you have such an idea and don't grow fast enough, competitors will. Growing too slowly is particularly dangerous in a business with network effects, which the best startups usually have to some degree.

为什么创始人想要拿风投的钱？再次是为了增长。好的创意和增长之间存在着制约关系。不仅仅是因为你需要一个可扩展的创意来实现增长。如果你有这样一个创意却增长得不够快，竞争对手就会出现。在具有网络效应的业务中，增长过慢尤其危险，而大多数最好的创业公司通常都具备一定程度的网络效应。

Almost every company needs some amount of funding to get started. But startups often raise money even when they are or could be profitable. It might seem foolish to sell stock in a profitable company for less than you think it will later be worth, but it's no more foolish than buying insurance. Fundamentally that's how the most successful startups view fundraising. They could grow the company on its own revenues, but the extra money and help supplied by VCs will let them grow even faster. Raising money lets you choose your growth rate.

几乎每家公司都需要一定的资金来启动。但是，即使是或可能是盈利的初创公司也经常筹集资金。以低于您认为以后会有的价值出售盈利公司的股票可能看起来很愚蠢，但这并不比购买保险更愚蠢。从根本上讲，这就是最成功的初创公司对待筹款的方式。他们可以通过自己的收入来发展公司，但风险投资者提供的额外资金和帮助将使他们的发展速度更快。筹集资金可以让您选择您的增长速度。

Money to grow faster is always at the command of the most successful startups, because the VCs need them more than they need the VCs. A profitable startup could if it wanted just grow on its own revenues. Growing slower might be slightly dangerous, but chances are it wouldn't kill them. Whereas VCs need to invest in startups, and in particular the most successful startups, or they'll be out of business. Which means that any sufficiently promising startup will be offered money on terms they'd be crazy to refuse. And yet because of the scale of the successes in the startup business, VCs can still make money from such investments. You'd have to be crazy to believe your company was going to become as valuable as a high growth rate can make it, but some do.

成功的初创企业总是能够获得更快速的资金增长，因为风险投资家比他们更需要这些企业。一个盈利的初创企业如果愿意的话，可以仅凭自身的收入来实现增长。增长速度较慢可能稍微有些危险，但很可能不会致命。而风险投资家需要投资初创企业，尤其是最成功的初创企业，否则他们将无法继续经营。这意味着任何有足够潜力的初创企业都将被提供资金，而这些条件对他们来说是不可拒绝的。然而，由于初创企业业务的成功规模，风险投资家仍然可以从这些投资中获利。你必须疯狂到相信你的公司会变得像高增长率所能使其变得那样有价值，但有些人确实这样认为。

Pretty much every successful startup will get acquisition offers too. Why? What is it about startups that makes other companies want to buy them? [13]

几乎每个成功的初创公司都会收到收购要约。为什么？是什么让其他公司想要收购初创公司呢？[13]

Fundamentally the same thing that makes everyone else want the stock of successful startups: a rapidly growing company is valuable. It's a good thing eBay bought Paypal, for example, because Paypal is now responsible for 43% of their sales and probably more of their growth.

基本上，与其他人想要成功初创企业的股票的原因相同：快速增长的公司是有价值的。例如，eBay收购Paypal是一件好事，因为现在Paypal负责他们43%的销售额，可能还负责更多的增长。

But acquirers have an additional reason to want startups. A rapidly growing company is not merely valuable, but dangerous. If it keeps expanding, it might expand into the acquirer's own territory. Most product acquisitions have some component of fear. Even if an acquirer isn't threatened by the startup itself, they might be alarmed at the thought of what a competitor could do with it. And because startups are in this sense doubly valuable to acquirers, acquirers will often pay more than an ordinary investor would. [14]

但是收购者有另一个想要收购初创公司的原因。一个快速增长的公司不仅有价值，而且具有危险性。如果它继续扩张，可能会进入收购者自己的领域。大多数产品收购都有一定程度的恐惧成分。即使收购者并不受到初创公司本身的威胁，他们可能会对竞争对手可能利用它的想法感到惊慌。而且，由于初创公司对收购者来说具有双重价值，收购者通常会支付比普通投资者更多的价格。[14]

Understand

The combination of founders, investors, and acquirers forms a natural ecosystem. It works so well that those who don't understand it are driven to invent conspiracy theories to explain how neatly things sometimes turn out. Just as our ancestors did to explain the apparently too neat workings of the natural world. But there is no secret cabal making it all work.

创始人、投资者和收购者的结合形成了一个自然的生态系统。它运作得如此顺利，以至于那些不理解的人被迫发明阴谋论来解释事情为什么有时候会如此顺利。就像我们的祖先为了解释自然界似乎过于完美的运行方式而做的一样。但并没有秘密的阴谋集团让一切都运转良好。

If you start from the mistaken assumption that Instagram was worthless, you have to invent a secret boss to force Mark Zuckerberg to buy it. To anyone who knows Mark Zuckerberg, that is the reductio ad absurdum of the initial assumption. The reason he bought Instagram was that it was valuable and dangerous, and what made it so was growth.

如果你从错误的假设出发，认为Instagram毫无价值，那么你就必须发明一个秘密老板来迫使马克·扎克伯格收购它。对于了解马克·扎克伯格的人来说，这是对最初假设的归谬。他收购Instagram的原因是它有价值且具有危险性，而使其具有危险性的是其增长。

If you want to understand startups, understand growth. Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups usually work on technology — because ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it's a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too.

如果你想了解创业公司，就要了解增长。增长驱动着世界上的一切。这就是为什么创业公司通常致力于技术——因为快速增长的公司的创意非常罕见，找到新的创意的最佳途径就是发现那些最近因变革而变得可行的创意，而技术是快速变革的最佳来源。这就是为什么对于很多创始人来说，尝试创办创业公司在经济上是一个理性的选择：增长使得成功的公司变得非常有价值，即使风险也很高，预期价值仍然很高。这就是为什么风险投资家想要投资创业公司的原因：不仅因为回报率高，而且因为从资本收益中获得回报比从股息中获得回报更容易管理。增长解释了为什么即使不需要，成功的创业公司几乎总是会收到收购要约。对于收购者来说，一个快速增长的公司不仅有价值，而且也很危险。

It's not just that if you want to succeed in some domain, you have to understand the forces driving it. Understanding growth is what starting a startup consists of. What you're really doing (and to the dismay of some observers, all you're really doing) when you start a startup is committing to solve a harder type of problem than ordinary businesses do. You're committing to search for one of the rare ideas that generates rapid growth. Because these ideas are so valuable, finding one is hard. The startup is the embodiment of your discoveries so far. Starting a startup is thus very much like deciding to be a research scientist: you're not committing to solve any specific problem; you don't know for sure which problems are soluble; but you're committing to try to discover something no one knew before. A startup founder is in effect an economic research scientist. Most don't discover anything that remarkable, but some discover relativity.

要在某个领域取得成功，不仅仅需要理解推动其发展的力量。理解增长是创办初创企业的核心。当你创办一家初创企业时，你真正做的事情（对一些观察者来说，你所做的一切）就是承诺解决比普通企业更难的问题。你承诺寻找那些能够迅速增长的稀缺想法之一，因为这些想法非常有价值，所以很难找到。初创企业是你迄今为止发现的体现。因此，创办初创企业非常类似于决定成为一名研究科学家：你并没有承诺解决任何具体的问题；你不确定哪些问题是可以解决的；但你承诺尝试去发现之前没有人知道的东西。创业者实际上是一名经济研究科学家。大多数人并没有发现什么特别的东西，但有些人发现了相对论。

Notes 笔记

[1] Strictly speaking it's not lots of customers you need but a big market, meaning a high product of number of customers times how much they'll pay. But it's dangerous to have too few customers even if they pay a lot, or the power that individual customers have over you could turn you into a de facto consulting firm. So whatever market you're in, you'll usually do best to err on the side of making the broadest type of product for it.

严格来说，你需要的不是大量的客户，而是一个大市场，即客户数量乘以他们愿意支付的金额。但是，即使他们支付很多，如果客户数量太少，他们对你的影响力可能会使你成为一家事实上的咨询公司，这是很危险的。所以，无论你处于哪个市场，通常最好的做法是在产品类型上尽量广泛。

[2] One year at Startup School David Heinemeier Hansson encouraged programmers who wanted to start businesses to use a restaurant as a model. What he meant, I believe, is that it's fine to start software companies constrained in (a) in the same way a restaurant is constrained in (b). I agree. Most people should not try to start startups.

在创业学校的一年里，David Heinemeier Hansson鼓励想要创办企业的程序员以餐厅作为模型。我相信他的意思是，像餐厅一样受限制地创办软件公司是可以的。我同意。大多数人不应该尝试创办初创企业。

[3] That sort of stepping back is one of the things we focus on at Y Combinator. It's common for founders to have discovered something intuitively without understanding all its implications. That's probably true of the biggest discoveries in any field.

那种退后一步是我们在Y Combinator关注的事情之一。创始人通常会在直觉上发现某些东西，但并不完全理解其所有的含义。这在任何领域的最重大的发现可能都是如此。

[4] I got it wrong in "How to Make Wealth" when I said that a startup was a small company that takes on a hard technical problem. That is the most common recipe but not the only one.

我在《如何创造财富》中说错了，当我说创业公司是一个解决困难技术问题的小公司。这是最常见的情况，但不是唯一的情况。

[5] In principle companies aren't limited by the size of the markets they serve, because they could just expand into new markets. But there seem to be limits on the ability of big companies to do that. Which means the slowdown that comes from bumping up against the limits of one's markets is ultimately just another way in which internal limits are expressed.

原则上，公司的规模并不受其服务市场的限制，因为它们可以扩展到新的市场。但是大公司似乎在这方面存在一定的限制。这意味着由于市场限制而导致的增长放缓，最终只是表达了内部限制的另一种方式。

It may be that some of these limits could be overcome by changing the shape of the organization — specifically by sharding it.

可能通过改变组织的形状，特别是通过分片，可以克服其中一些限制。

[6] This is, obviously, only for startups that have already launched or can launch during YC. A startup building a new database will probably not do that. On the other hand, launching something small and then using growth rate as evolutionary pressure is such a valuable technique that any company that could start this way probably should.

这显然只适用于已经启动或可以在YC期间启动的初创公司。一个正在构建新数据库的初创公司可能不会这样做。另一方面，推出一些小东西，然后利用增长率作为进化压力是一种非常有价值的技术，任何能够以这种方式开始的公司可能都应该这样做。

[7] If the startup is taking the Facebook/Twitter route and building something they hope will be very popular but from which they don't yet have a definite plan to make money, the growth rate has to be higher, even though it's a proxy for revenue growth, because such companies need huge numbers of users to succeed at all.

如果创业公司选择了Facebook/Twitter的路线，希望构建一个非常受欢迎的产品，但却没有明确的盈利计划，那么增长率必须更高，即使它只是收入增长的代理，因为这样的公司需要大量用户才能成功。

Beware too of the edge case where something spreads rapidly but the churn is high as well, so that you have good net growth till you run through all the potential users, at which point it suddenly stops.

请注意，还有一种特殊情况，即某物迅速传播，但流失率也很高，因此在你耗尽所有潜在用户之前，你会有良好的净增长，但此时增长突然停止。

[8] Within YC when we say it's ipso facto right to do whatever gets you growth, it's implicit that this excludes trickery like buying users for more than their lifetime value, counting users as active when they're really not, bleeding out invites at a regularly increasing rate to manufacture a perfect growth curve, etc. Even if you were able to fool investors with such tricks, you'd ultimately be hurting yourself, because you're throwing off your own compass.

在YC内部，当我们说无论如何实现增长都是正确的，这隐含着排除了像以超过用户终身价值购买用户、将非活跃用户计算为活跃用户、以定期递增的速度消耗邀请来制造完美的增长曲线等欺诈行为。即使你能够用这些伎俩愚弄投资者，最终你也会伤害自己，因为你会迷失自己的方向。

[9] Which is why it's such a dangerous mistake to believe that successful startups are simply the embodiment of some brilliant initial idea. What you're looking for initially is not so much a great idea as an idea that could evolve into a great one. The danger is that promising ideas are not merely blurry versions of great ones. They're often different in kind, because the early adopters you evolve the idea upon have different needs from the rest of the market. For example, the idea that evolves into Facebook isn't merely a subset of Facebook; the idea that evolves into Facebook is a site for Harvard undergrads.

这就是为什么认为成功的创业公司仅仅是某个杰出初始想法的体现是一个如此危险的错误。最初你要寻找的不是一个伟大的想法，而是一个能够演变成伟大想法的想法。危险在于有前景的想法并不仅仅是伟大想法的模糊版本。它们通常在本质上不同，因为你演变想法的早期采用者与市场其他人有不同的需求。例如，演变成Facebook的想法不仅仅是Facebook的一个子集；演变成Facebook的想法是一个为哈佛大学本科生设计的网站。

[10] What if a company grew at 1.7x a year for a really long time? Could it not grow just as big as any successful startup? In principle yes, of course. If our hypothetical company making $1000 a month grew at 1% a week for 19 years, it would grow as big as a company growing at 5% a week for 4 years. But while such trajectories may be common in, say, real estate development, you don't see them much in the technology business. In technology, companies that grow slowly tend not to grow as big.

如果一家公司每年增长1.7倍，那么它是否能像任何成功的初创公司一样变得很大？原则上是可以的，当然。如果我们假设的每月收入为1000美元的公司每周增长1%，那么它将在19年内变得和一家每周增长5%的公司一样大。但是，虽然这样的增长轨迹在房地产开发等领域可能很常见，但在技术行业并不常见。在技术行业，增长缓慢的公司往往不会变得很大。

[11] Any expected value calculation varies from person to person depending on their utility function for money. I.e. the first million is worth more to most people than subsequent millions. How much more depends on the person. For founders who are younger or more ambitious the utility function is flatter. Which is probably part of the reason the founders of the most successful startups of all tend to be on the young side.

任何预期值的计算因个人的金钱效用函数而异。即第一百万对大多数人来说比后续的百万更有价值。具体价值取决于个人。对于年轻或更有雄心壮志的创始人来说，效用函数更为平坦。这可能是为什么最成功的初创企业的创始人往往年轻的部分原因。

[12] More precisely, this is the case in the biggest winners, which is where all the returns come from. A startup founder could pull the same trick of enriching himself at the company's expense by selling them overpriced components. But it wouldn't be worth it for the founders of Google to do that. Only founders of failing startups would even be tempted, but those are writeoffs from the VCs' point of view anyway.

更准确地说，这是在最大的赢家中的情况，也就是所有回报都来自这里。一位初创公司的创始人可以通过以高价出售零部件来以公司为代价使自己变得富有。但对于谷歌的创始人来说，这样做是不值得的。只有失败的初创公司的创始人才会受到诱惑，但从风险投资者的角度来看，这些公司已经被视为无效投资。

[13] Acquisitions fall into two categories: those where the acquirer wants the business, and those where the acquirer just wants the employees. The latter type is sometimes called an HR acquisition. Though nominally acquisitions and sometimes on a scale that has a significant effect on the expected value calculation for potential founders, HR acquisitions are viewed by acquirers as more akin to hiring bonuses.

收购分为两类：一类是收购方希望获得业务，另一类是收购方只想要雇员。后一种类型有时被称为人力资源收购。虽然从名义上来说是收购，有时对潜在创始人的预期价值计算产生重大影响，但收购方认为人力资源收购更类似于雇佣奖金。

[14] I once explained this to some founders who had recently arrived from Russia. They found it novel that if you threatened a company they'd pay a premium for you. "In Russia they just kill you," they said, and they were only partly joking. Economically, the fact that established companies can't simply eliminate new competitors may be one of the most valuable aspects of the rule of law. And so to the extent we see incumbents suppressing competitors via regulations or patent suits, we should worry, not because it's a departure from the rule of law per se but from what the rule of law is aiming at.

我曾向一些刚从俄罗斯来的创始人解释过这一点。他们觉得很新奇，如果你威胁一家公司，他们会为你支付溢价。他们说：“在俄罗斯他们只会杀了你”，他们只是部分开玩笑。从经济角度来看，已经建立起来的公司不能简单地消除新的竞争对手，可能是法治最有价值的方面之一。因此，如果我们看到现有公司通过法规或专利诉讼压制竞争对手，我们应该担心，不是因为这是法治的偏离，而是因为这偏离了法治的目标。
